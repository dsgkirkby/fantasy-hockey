SCHEMA CHANGES

1. Users
We made a small change to users, adding is_admin as a boolean field.
This was not so much a change as an oversight, as we forgot to include a way to recognize administrators in our initial schema.

2. F_Teams
We added a unique id to each record in f_teams, as using the name as part of the primary key (that would need to be passed around in php and javascript functions) resulted in a limitation of the characters that could be used in team names (for example, no quotes) which would disrupt a user’s creativity when choosing a team name.
Changing the primary key of f_teams also resulted in a change to player_assignments, given that it must store the primary key of an f_team.

3. Season_records
We removed the season_records table, which was originally designed to store the stats accumulated by a player while playing for a given fantasy team. However, having both this and plays_for (which stored the stats for a player and an nhl_team) was a source of redundancy. We removed season_records, and instead shifted the burden of storing the relationship between players and f_teams to player_assignments, and we could compute a players stats for his respective f_teams by performing a join on player_assignments, players, and plays_for.

4. Manages
Finally, we added a table to store the managers of leagues. This was once again simply an oversight in our original schema.
